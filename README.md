# Face Recognition Attendance System

This Python script utilizes face recognition technology to automate attendance marking. It captures video feed from a webcam, detects faces, matches them against a database of known faces, and marks attendance accordingly. The attendance data is stored in an Excel spreadsheet.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- face_recognition
- openpyxl

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script files directly.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:

   
    pip install opencv-python
    pip install face-recognition
    pip install openpyxl
  

## Usage

1. Place images of known faces in the same directory as the script.
2. Rename the images according to the corresponding names or IDs.
3. Run the script:

   
    python face_recognition_attendance.py
  

4. The script will capture the webcam feed, recognize faces, and mark attendance in the Excel sheet.
5. Press 'q' to quit the application.

## File Structure

- `face_recognition_attendance.py`: Main Python script.
- `1.jpg`, `5.jpg`, `7.jpg`, `3.jpg`, `4.jpg`: Sample images of known faces.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.
